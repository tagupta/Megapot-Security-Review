 *      - Uses Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for uniform distribution
 *      - Implements rejection sampling to eliminate modulo bias
 *      - Supports configurable range and sample count
 *      - Ensures each selected number has equal probability
 *      - Optimized for jackpot drawing and other applications requiring provable fairness
 *      - Returns selections without replacement (no duplicates)

    /**
     * @notice Generates random numbers using Fisher-Yates shuffle with rejection sampling
     * @dev Implements unbiased random selection by:
     *      1. Building a pool of all numbers in the specified range
     *      2. Using Fisher-Yates shuffle with rejection sampling to avoid modulo bias
     *      3. Selecting the first 'count' numbers from the shuffled pool
     *      The rejection sampling ensures uniform distribution by rejecting random values
     *      that would create bias when reduced to the required range. Developer needs to ensure
     *      that the range is not too large to be able to build an array of the appropriate size
     *      in memory.
     * @param minRange Minimum value in the selection range (inclusive)
     * @param maxRange Maximum value in the selection range (inclusive)
     * @param count Number of unique values to select
     * @param seed Cryptographic seed for random number generation
     * @return result Array of selected numbers in the order they were shuffled
     * @custom:requirements
     * - count must be <= (maxRange - minRange + 1) to ensure sufficient pool size
     * - minRange must be <= maxRange for valid range
     * - seed should be cryptographically secure for unbiased results
     * @custom:effects
     * - Returns 'count' unique numbers from the specified range
     * - Each number in range has equal probability of selection
     * - No duplicates in the result array
     * @custom:security
     * - Rejection sampling eliminates modulo bias
     * - Fisher-Yates algorithm ensures uniform distribution
     * - Deterministic output for given seed enables verification
     * - Gas usage scales with rejection rate (worst case for biased ranges)
